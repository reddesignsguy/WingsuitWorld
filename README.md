## Snapshots

You can now join **aerial races** where the objective is to **glide near obstacles** and **fly through tight gaps** to earn as many points as possible! Beware, however, as crashing before reaching the next checkpoint will cause you to lose all the points you've earned since the last checkpoint. In addition, you can collect coins that are scattered throughout the racetrack, which will be useful when perks and cosmetics are introduced ;)

Hello everyone. I'm happy to announce the very first snapshot of the game featuring AWESOME-feeling wingsuit gliding. There's a couple more fine-tuning  and newer additions like sound FX, camera shake, speed rebalancing, etc to be done, but I couldn't help myself from sharing current progress.

Wingsuit gliding is the primary loop of the game and I want to ensure that it works perfectly before I move onto the other loops of the game.

After perfecting flight, the following loops are to be conquered in development:
